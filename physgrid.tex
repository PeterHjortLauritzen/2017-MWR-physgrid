\abstract{Atmospheric modeling with element-based high-order Galerkin methods presents a unique challenge to the conventional physics-dynamics coupling paradigm, due to the highly irregular distribtuion of nodes within an element, and the distinct numerical charactersitics of the Galerkin method. The conventional coupling procedure is to evaluate the physical parameterizations (`physics') on the dynamical core grid. Evaluating the physics at the nodal points exacerbates numerical noise from the Galerkin method, enabling and amplifying local extrema at element boundaries. Grid imprinting may be substantially reduced through the introduction of an entirely separate, approximately isotropic finite-volume grid for evaluating the physics forcing. Integration of the spectral basis over the control-volumes provides an area average state to the physics, which is more representative of the state in the vicinity of the nodal ponits rather than the nodal point itself, and is more consistent with the notion of a `large-scale state' required by conventional physics packages. This study documents the implementation of a quasi-equal area physics grid into NCAR's Community Atmosphere Model with Spectral Elements, and is shown to be effective at mitigating grid imprinting in the solution. The physics grid is also appropriate for coupling to other componenents of the Community Earth System Model, since the coupler requires component fluxes to be defined on a finite-volume grid, and one can be certain that the fluxes on the physics grid are indeed, volume-averaged.}

\section{Introduction}
An increasing number of numerical methods publications in the atmospheric science literature concern transport, shallow-water, and three-dimensional models employing element-based high-order Galerkin discretizations such as finite-element and discontinuous Galerkin methods \citep[for an introduction to these methods see, e.g., ][]{Durran,NLL2011LNCSE}. Some global models based on Galerkin methods have reached a level of maturity for which they are being considered for next generation climate and weather models due to their inherent conservation properties, high-order accuracy (for smooth problems), high parallel efficiency, high processor efficiency, and geometric flexibility facilitating mesh-refinement applications. NCAR's Community Atmosphere Model \citep[CAM; ][]{CAM5} offers a dynamical core based on continuous Galerkin finite elements \citep{TF2010JCP}, referred to as CAM-SE \citep[CAM Spectral Elements; ][]{DetAl2012IJHPCA,TES2008JPCS,LetAl2017MWR}. CAM-SE is, in particular, being used for high resolution climate modeling \citep[e.g., ][]{JAME:JAME20125,RetAl2015GRL,BETAL2018CC} and static mesh-refinement applications \citep[e.g., ][]{FT2004MWR,ZetAl2014JC,ZetAl2014JCb,GetAl2014GMD,RHUZ2016JAMC}. Other examples of models based on high-order Galerkin methods that are being considered for `operational' weather-climate applications are \citet{Giraldo20083849}, \citet{NCT2009CF} and \citet{BSBDK2013TCFD}.

\end{figure}

Assumptions inherent to the physical parameterizations (also referred to as {\em{physics}}) require the state passed by the dynamical core to represent a `large-scale state', for example, in quasi-equilibrium-type convection schemes \citep{AS1974JAS,PC2008JAS}. In finite-volme methods, one may think of the dynamical core state as the average state of the atmosphere over a control volume, and for resolutions typical of climate simulations is entirely consistent with the notion of a `large-scale state'. For finite-difference methods the point value is thought of as representative for the atmospheric state in the vicinity of the point value and one can usually associate a volume with the grid-point. Hence the physics grid (the grid on which the state of the atmosphere is evaluated and passed to physics) and the dynamics grid (the grid the dynamical core uses) coincide. Having the physics and dynamics grids coincide is obviously convenient since no interpolation is needed (which could disrupt conservation properties) and the number of degrees of freedom on both grids is exactly the same. 

For the regular latitude-longitude, cubed-sphere and icosahedral grids the distance between the grid-points is gradually varying for finite-volume/finite-difference discretizations. For high-order element-based Galerkin methods, the dynamical core grid is defined by the quadrature points. For the case of CAM-SE these are the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) quadrature nodes. A unique aspect of the high-order quadrature rules is that the nodes within an element are not equally spaced, but are distributed according to the unequally spaced roots of the basis set. For example, Figure \ref{fig:gll-grids} shows GLL points on an individual element of a cubed-sphere grid for degree 3 ($np=4$ quadrature points) and degree 7 ($np=8$ quadrature points) Lagrange polynomial basis in CAM-SE. Both grids have the same average resolution on the sphere (due to different number of elements), however, the higher the order of the quadrature rule the less equi-distant are the quadrature points. GLL quadrature points cluster near the edges and, in particular, the corners of the elements.

\begin{figure}[t]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=19pc,angle=0]{figs/se_gll_cv_grid.eps}\\
\caption{An example of control volumes constructed around GLL quadrature points (NE4NP4) so that the spherical area of the control volumes exactly match the quadrature weight multiplied by the metric factor.}
\label{fig:cv-grids}
\end{figure}

If the conventional physics-dynamics coupling paradign is applied to CAM-SE, then the physics are to be evaluated at the GLL nodes, and a volume associated with the quadrature point should be defined. An example of that is shown on Figure \ref{fig:cv-grids} where control volumes have been defined around the quadrature points so that the spherical area of the control volumes exactly match the Gaussian weight multiplied by the metric term (these weights are used for integrating the basis functions over the elements and can therefore, in this context, be interpreted as areas). This grid is used in the NCAR CESM (Community Earth System Model) coupler for passing states between ocean, atmosphere and land components since the current remapping method is finite-volume based and therefore requires control volumes (it is noted that methods exist that do not require control volumes for conservative interpolation \citep{UT2015MWR}). Hence the components `see' an irregular atmospheric grid. Similarly, the parameterizations in the atmosphere `see' a state that is anisotropically sampled in space \citep[see Figure 1 and 5 in ][]{KetAl2008JGR}.% Physical inconsistencies may arise, for example, if assumptions inherent to the physics break down only at the smallest control volumes on the grid.

The scales of motion are determined by the degree of the polynomial basis in each element, and the nodes may be viewed as irregularly spaced samples of an underlying spectrally truncated state. From this perspective, one might expect the nodal solutions to be independent of within element location. While the interior quadrature nodes are high-order $C^{\infty}$ in CAM-SE (i.e. the basis representation is infinetly smooth and all derivatives are continuous), the smoothness of boundary nodes are constrained by the need to average nieghboring solutions together to form the global basis set, known as the direct stiffness summation operation \citep[DSS; ][]{NLL2011LNCSE}. The DSS operation is attractive because it allows for high-order accuracy with minimial communication between elements, but degrades the solution to $C^0$ at element boundaries (i.e., all derivates are discontinous). Through evaluating the physics at the nodal points, strong grid-scale forcing or oscillatory behavior near an element boundary may exacerbate the discontinuity, and our initial expectation, that the nodal solutions are indepdent of within-element location, is unlikely (Figure~\ref{fig:se-schematic}). 

To test whether the nodal solutions are dependent on within-element position, an aqua-planet simulation \citep{NH2000ASL,MWO2016JAMES} is carried out using CAM-SE. The probability density distribution of the upward vertical pressure velocity ($\omega$), conditionally sampled based on three categories - `interior nodes', `edge' and `corner' nodes - is provided in \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes}. Their is an apparent dependence on nodal location, with interior nodes being characteristically sluggish, while `corner' and `edge' solutions have consistently larger magnitude motion vertical motion. This behavior is consistent with the smoothness properties of the nodal locations, the pressure gradients at the boundaries (`corner' and `edge' nodes) are discontiuous and systematically tighter, driving greater vertical motion. The main division of solutions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:omega-se-volumes} is primiarily between whether a node is, or is not situated on an element boundary, and is a nuanced signature of high-order element-based Galerkin methods for non-smooth problems. %It would be incorrect to interpet the irregular size of control volumes in Figure~\ref{fig:cv-grids} as an equivalent spread in the scales of motion resolved by the dynamical core. 

%The greater magnitude vertical motion of boundary nodes in Figure~\ref{fig:omega-se-volumes} is therefore due to the systematically tighter pressure gradients on element boundaries.

\end{figure}

The quadrature grid in element-based Galerkin methods is defined to perform mathematical operations on the basis functions, e.g., computing gradients and integrals, rather than evaluating the state variables for physics-dynamics coupling. One may argue that it would be more consistent to integrate the basis functions over quasi-equal area control volumes within each element and pass those control volume average values to physics rather than irregularly spaced quadrature point values. In this case when integrating basis functions over control volumes a grid-cell average value is more representative of the values near the extrema at the element boundary than the quadrature point value. The relationship between the nodal values, the basis functions and the proposed control volumes is illustrated schematically in one-dimension in parts (f) and (i) in Figure~\ref{fig:se-schematic}.

It is the purpose of this paper to document the implementation of a quasi-equal area physics grid into CAM-SE, in which the physics and dynamics grids are entirely separated as illustrated in one dimension in parts (f) and (i) of Figure~\ref{fig:se-schematic}, and the impact on model solution. The implementation of the physics grid configuration into CAM-SE is presented in Section 2. Idealized model configurations with and without topography are presented in Section 3, illustrating the physics grid is effective at mitigating undesireable grid imprinting in the solution. Section 4 contains a discussion of results and concluding remarks. 

\section{Methods}
Here we focus on CAM-SE, however, in principle the methods apply to any element-based high-order Galerkin model. The physics grid in CAM-SE is defined by sub-dividing each element using equi-angular gnomonic coordinate lines to define the sides of the physics grid control volumes. Note that the element boundaries are defined by equi-angular gnomonic grid lines. The notation $pg=3$ refers to the configuration where the elements are divided into $pg\times pg=3\times 3$ quasi equal-area physics grid cells (see Figure \ref{fig:np4_pg3}). Defining the physics grid by sub-diving elements makes it possible to use the same infrastructure as used for the quadrature point values thereby facilitating its implementation in CAM-SE. Here we make use of the $ne30np4$ and $ne30pg3$ grids that use GLL quadrature point physics grid (physics and dynamics grid coincide), and the same ($pg=3$) resolution quasi equal-area physics grids, respectively. In all configurations we use degree three Lagrange basis ($np=4$) and $ne\times ne=30\times 30$ elements on each cubed-sphere panel resulting in an average GLL quadrature point spacing at the Equator of $1^\circ$. %Vertical grid spacing is the standard CAM5 configuration ($nlev=30$)

Separation of the physics and dynamics grids was made possible through the implementation of the Conservative Semi-Lagrangian Multi-tracer transport scheme in CAM-SE (CAM-SE-CSLAM; \cite{LTOUNGK2017MWR}). Tracers evolve in CSLAM using a semi-lagrangian method on the $pg=3$ finite-volume grid (Figure~\ref{fig:np4_pg3}). The physics grid configuration is distinct from CAM-SE in that it uses the finite-volume grid to copmute the phyiscs and the tracers, using CSLAM. For this reason, the physics grid configuration is referred to as CAM-SE-CSLAM throughout the study.

\section{Results}

The CAM aqua-planet reference configuration \citep{NH2000ASL,MWO2016JAMES} consists of an ocean covered planet in a perpetual equinox, with fixed, zonally symmetric SST temperatures idealized after the present day climatology. Two year long aqua-planet simulations are performed using CAM-SE in the $ne30np4$ configuration, and CAM-SE-CSLAM in a $ne30pg3$ configuration. A plot similar to Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes} is constructed for the $ne30pg3$ simulation, in which a probability density distribution of upward $\omega$ is conditionally sampled based on location within the element. In the $ne30pg3$ configuration, the sampling is based on a grid cell index 1-9, corresponding to the control volume location within the element (Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes}). Through the use of the physics grid, the dynamical state appears independent of location within the element, a marked improvement over the $ne30np4$ configuration (Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes}). Since the state is independent of in-element location, it follows that the physics forcing, which is evaluted from the state, should also be independent of within-element location. 

The low-level, mean and variance of the physics tendencies in the two aqua-planet simulations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tendency_imprint}. The mean states in $ne30np4$ and $ne30pg3$ resemble each another (Figure~\ref{fig:tendency_imprint}), consistent with the similar climatological zonal mean precipitation rates in both simulations (not shown). The mean physics tendencies contains modest grid imprinting in the $ne30np4$ configuration, while in the variance field, grid imprinting is both ubiquitous and unmistakable (Figure~\ref{fig:tendency_imprint}). The variance is larger on boundary nodes (Figure~\ref{fig:tendency_imprint}), manifesting as a `stitching' pattern resembling the cube-sphere grid. In $ne30pg3$, the grid imprinting is all but eliminated based on the mean and variance of the physics tendencies (Figure~\ref{fig:tendency_imprint}).

\noindent\includegraphics[width=19pc,angle=0]{figs/QPC6_bar_skk.pdf}\\

Grid imprinting is observed along the element boundaries in $ne30np4$, but is absent from the $ne30pg3$ simulation.}
\label{fig:tendency_imprint}
\end{figure}

Grid imprinting associated with the flow around obstacles is more problematic than that encountered on the aqua-planets. In order to diagnose grid imprinting due to topographic flow, an idealized held-suarez conifugration \citep{HS1994} is outfitted with real world topography after \cite{FRETAL2000WMR,BETAL2006MWR}, and ran for a year using the $ne30np4$ and $ne30pg3$ configurations. Figure~\ref{fig:FHS-contours} shows the mean $\omega$ at two different vertical levels in the middle troposphere. At higher latitudes (e.g., the southern Andes), the flow is smooth, conforming reasonably to the underlying topography. At lower latitudes, over the Andes or the Himlayas, their is a clear preferance for larger magnitude vertical motion to occur at the element boundaries (Figure~\ref{fig:FHS-contours}). The vertical structure of $\omega$ in regions of strong grid-imprinting is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:FHS-transect}, which are great-circle distance-pressure transects over the Andes and Himalayas. The $\omega$ field indicates large magnitude upward motion occurs as the flow approaches the foot of a topographic obstacle. Compensating downward motion tends to occur a couple of nodes downwind of the strong upward motion (although sometimes they form up-wind). The full troposphere upward-downward couplets are an indication that grid imprinting due to topography is enhanced in regions of weak stratificaiton, such as occurs in the deep tropics, with forced upslope flow facilitating the release of gravitational instabilty. The greater magnitude vertical motion is a result of the characteristically tighter pressure gradients at element boundaries. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=19pc,angle=0]{figs/FHS-contours-CROP.pdf}\\
\caption{Mean $\omega$ at two model levels in the middle troposphere, in a Held-Suarez configuration outfitted with real world topography. (Left) CAM-SE state on the GLL grid, $ne30np4$, (Middle) CAM-SE-CSLAM state on the GLL grid, $ne30np4$ and (Right) CAM-SE-CSLAM state on the physics grid, $ne30pg3$. The $\omega$ fields are computed from a 1200 day Held-Suarez simulation. White lines denote the great circle transects in \ref{fig:FHS-transect}. Note that the level indices increase downward, where $nlev=30$ is the lowest model level.}
\label{fig:FHS-contours}
\end{figure}


%The grid-imprinting tends to be exaggerated in the modified held-suarez configuration, compared to more realistic configurations using a complete physical parameterization package. Figure~\ref{fig:FHS-contours} depicts the $omega$ field in an AMIP simulation, which contains less grid imprinting compared to the Held-Suarez configuration through the use of the CAM6 physics pacakge \citep{}. Physics packages contain convection schemes, whose purpose is to remove gravitational instabilites through subgrid-scale vetical mixing. Since the idealized Held-Suarez physics does not contain a convection scheme, the dynamical core tends to be more active in removing gravitational instability, compared to a full physics configuration. Note that the implications of this finding are that one can accept a level of grid-impriniting in the modified Held-Suarez configuration, and trust that it will be absent in more real-world configurations.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=19pc,angle=0]{figs/FHS-transect-CROP.pdf}\\
\caption{Great circle distance-pressure transect of $\omega$ in the Held-Suarez simulations with realistic topography. The $\omega$ field is computed from a 1200 day simulation.}
\label{fig:FHS-transect}
\end{figure}

Through the use of the quasi-equal area physics grid, grid imprinting due to topographic flow is reduced (Figures~\ref{fig:FHS-contours} and \ref{fig:FHS-transect}). Figures~\ref{fig:FHS-contours} and \ref{fig:FHS-transect} also show the state in CAM-SE-CSLAM, but on the dynamical core grid. Arguably, grid imprinting due to topography in CAM-SE-CSLAM is not much of an improvment over CAM-SE, from the perspective of the dynamical core grid. Some regions (e.g., the Andes) appear to have a larger grid imprinting signal, relative to CAM-SE, while other regions (e.g., Himalayas) indicate an improvement. The native topography lives on the physics grid, and the surface geopotential is mapped to the nodal points at run-time in CAM-SE-CSLAM. Mapping topography to the quadrature nodes ensures that no new extrema will be introduced to the boundary nodes, where the solution is least smooth. This effect can not be very large, apparent from the conflicting influence of the physics grid on grid imprinting on the dynamical core grid. From the perspective of the physics grid, the CAM-SE-CSLAM solution clearly contains less grid imprinting compared to CAM-SE (Figures~\ref{fig:FHS-contours} and \ref{fig:FHS-transect}). The reduction in grid imprinting in CAM-SE-CSLAM is therefore almost entirely a result of the smoothing effect of integrating the basis functions over the control volumes of the physics grid.

\section{Conclusions}

Element-based high-order Galerkin Methods possess many of the attractive qualitites recommended for next generation global atmopsheric models. Among these, high-order accuracy is acheived with minimal communication between elements, allowing for near perfect scaling on massively parallel systems. Element communication amounts to a numerical flux applied to the element boundaries, reconciling overlapping solutions of adjacent elements but degrading the smoothness of the boundary nodes in the process (to $C^0$). For non-smooth problems, gradients are systematically tighter at the element boundaries, and local extrema often characerize the boundary nodes. This behavior is illustrated using NCAR's Community Atmosphere Model with Spectral Elements dynamics (CAM-SE) in an aqua-planet configuration, and in a Held-Suarez configuration with real-world topography. 

The authors argue that the conventional physics-dynamics coupling paradigm, in which the physical parameterizations are evaluated on the dynamical core grid, exacerbates grid imprinting by commuting boundary node extrema through the physics forcing. A separate physics grid is proposed and implemented in CAM-SE, and referred to as CAM-SE-CSLAM, through dividing the elements into quasi-equal areas with equivalent degrees of freedom. The state is mapped to the physics grid with high-order accuracy through integrating CAM-SE's Lagrange basis functions over the control volumes. Control volumes near element boundaries now represent a state in the vicinity of the extrema produced through the boundary exchange operation, as opposed to the the nodal value itself. The physical parameterizations are evaluated on the finite volume grid, and the forcing terms are mapped back to the dynamical core grid using a cubic tensor-product Lagrange interpolation. {\color{red}{The mapping procedures do not conserve total energy, nor axial angular momentum, but energy and AAM diagnostics indicate that these errors are unimportant.}} In aqua-planet simulations, evaluating the parameterizations on the physics grid removes any obvious dependence of proximity to the element boundary, resulting in a more realistic state with negligeable grid imprinting.

%{\color{red}{, which is consistent, conservative (for scalar quantities), monotonic (for tracers) and preserves linear correlations}}

In CAM-SE-CSLAM, the physics grid replaces the default finite-volume grid used to compute fluxes between model components in CAM-SE (Figure~\ref{fig:cv-grids}). The appeal here is two-fold. Through integrating the Lagrange basis functions over control volumes, one can be certain that the fluxes computed from this grid are a volume averaged flux. The same can not be said for CAM-SE, where the nodal values are effectively assigned to each control volume. The second advantage of the new coupler grid, is that extrema occuring on boundary nodes can no longer commute through other model components, in simulations without topography. Topographically induced grid imprinting is reduced through the use the physics grid, primarily through the smoothing effect of integrating the basis functions over the control volumes on the physics grid, although grid imprinting is still observable in the mean state. The quasi-equal area physics grid is nonetheless effective at mitigating numerical nuances associated with high-order element-based Galerkin methods, for non-smooth problems.
