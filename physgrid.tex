\section{Methods}
\subsection{Remapping state: GLL grid $\rightarrow$ physics grid}
Requirements for the mapping algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item mass-conservative,
\item shape-preserving (monotone),
\item consistent (preserves a constant),
\item preserve basis function order for smooth fields.
\end{itemize}
A possible desirable property is total energy conservation (not pursued here).

In order to achieve conservation of scalar and air mass during the remapping process the constituent mixing ratios are weighted by the pressure level thickness $\Delta p$ before the mapping:
\begin{equation}
\psi=\phi_k\, \Delta p_k,
\end{equation}
where sub-script $k$ refers to the level index. [conversion back]

\caption{(a) Smooth function ($2+\cos(\theta)$) initialized on the $NE5NP4$ GLL grid. (b) and (c) show the difference between the interpolated field and the analytical value at the physics grid cell center. The interpolation is from the $NE5NP4$ GLL grid to the NE5NP4NC3 physics grid (both have an approximate grid spacing of $6^\circ$). In (b) the interpolation algorithm is the default algorithm that is higher-order for smooth fields, shape-preserving, consistent, and mass-conservative. (c) is the same as (b) but using the first-order mapping method. All data has been bilinearly interpolated to a $1^\circ$ regular latitude-longitude grid for plotting.}\label{fig:remap-smooth-field}
