\section{Introduction}
An increasing number of numerical methods publications in the atmospheric science literature concern transport, shallow-water, and three-dimensional models employing element-based high-order Galerkin discretizations such as finite-element and discontinuous Galerkin methods \citep[for an introduction to these methods see, e.g., ][]{Durran,NLL2011LNCSE}. Some global models based on Galerkin methods have reached a level of maturity for which they are being considered for next generation climate and weather models due to their inherent conservation properties, high-order accuracy (for smooth problems), high parallel efficiency, high processor efficiency, and geometric flexibility facilitating mesh-refinement applications. NCAR's Community Atmosphere Model \citep[CAM; ][]{CAM5} offers a dynamical core based on continuous Galerkin finite elements \citep{TF2010JCP}, referred to as CAM-SE \citep[CAM Spectral Elements; ][]{DetAl2012IJHPCA,TES2008JPCS,LetAl2017MWR}. CAM-SE is, in particular, being used for high resolution climate modeling \citep[e.g., ][]{JAME:JAME20125,BetAl2013JC,RetAl2015GRL} and static mesh-refinement applications \citep[e.g., ][]{FT2004MWR,ZetAl2014JC,ZetAl2014JCb,GetAl2014GMD,RHUZ2016}. Other examples of models based on high-order Galerkin methods that are being considered for `operational' weather-climate applications are \citet{Giraldo20083849}, \citet{NCT2009CF} and \citet{BSBDK2013TCFD}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=19pc,angle=0]{figs/quadrature-fig/gll.pdf}\\
\caption{Example of CAM-SE GLL quadrature grids, marked with red filled circles, (a \& c) on the cubed-sphere and (b \& d) in an element.

(a) and (c) have the same average grid-spacing at the Equator (7.5$^\circ$) which is obtained by using (a) $4\times 4$ ($ne=4$) and (b) $2\times 2$ ($ne=2$) elements on each cubed-sphere face/panel, respectively. The element boundaries are marked with thick light blue lines. The grid configurations shown on (a) and (c) are referred to as $ne4np4$ and $ne2np8$, respectively.}
\label{fig:gll-grids}
\end{figure}

Traditionally the state of the atmosphere passed to the sub-grid-scale parameterizations (also referred to as {\em{physics}}) for models based on finite-volume and finite-difference methods has been the cell-averaged state in each control volume and the grid-point value, respectively. For the regular latitude-longitude, cubed-sphere and icosahedral grids the distance between the grid-points is gradually varying for finite-volume/finite-difference discretizations. If the same physics-dynamics coupling paradigm is applied to high-order element-based Galerkin methods, the state of the atmosphere passed to physics would be evaluated at the quadrature points. In the case of CAM-SE these are the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) quadrature points. Having the physics and dynamics grids coincide is obviously convenient since no interpolation is needed (which could disrupt conservation properties) and the number of degrees of freedom on both grids is exactly the same. A unique aspect of the high-order quadrature rules is that the nodes within an element are not equally spaced. For example, Figure \ref{fig:gll-grids} shows GLL points on an individual element of a cubed-sphere grid for degree 3 ($np=4$ quadrature points) and degree 7 ($np=8$ quadrature points) Lagrange polynomial basis in CAM-SE. Both grids have the same average resolution on the sphere (due to different number of elements), however, the higher the order of the quadrature rule the less equi-distant are the quadrature points. GLL quadrature points cluster near the edges and, in particular, the corners of the elements.

\caption{Probability density distribution of instantaneous upward $\omega$, conditionally sampled based on interior, edge and corner node location. Figure is constructed from 1 year of six hourly data, +/- 10 degrees from the equator, and at all vertical levels. Note the consistent higher $omega$ values for interior nodes, compared to $\omega$ associated with buondary nodes. The question is then, whether the in-element bias in solution commutes through the physical parameterizations.}\label{fig:omega-se-volumes}
\end{figure}

Parameterizations use the state of the atmosphere from the dynamical core as the large-scale state for computing sub-grid-scale processes. For example, the dynamical core state defines the large-scale environment in a mass-flux based convection scheme. One may think of the dynamical core state as the average state of the atmosphere over a control volume as inherent to finite-volume methods. For finite-difference methods the point value is thought of as representative for the atmospheric state in the vicinity of the point value and one can usually associate a volume with the grid-point. Hence the physics grid (the grid on which the state of the atmosphere is evaluated and passed to physics) and the dynamics grid (the grid the dynamical core uses) coincide. If we apply this concept to GLL quadrature values then a volume associated with the quadrature point should be defined. An example of that is shown on Figure \ref{fig:cv-grids} where control volumes have been defined around the quadrature points so that the spherical area of the control volumes exactly match the Gaussian weight multiplied by the metric term (these weights are used for integrating the basis functions over the elements and can therefore, in this context, be interpreted as areas). [{\color{red}{Mark: could we be mathematically more rigorous? perhaps an appendix describing the iterative algorithm?}}] This grid is used in the NCAR CESM (Community Earth System Model) coupler for passing states between ocean, atmosphere and land-ice components since the current remapping method is finite-volume based and therefore requires control volumes {\footnote{it is noted that methods exist that do not require control volumes for conservative interpolation \citep{UT2015MWR}}}. Hence the components `see' an irregular atmospheric grid. Similarly, the parameterizations in the atmosphere `see' a state that is anisotropically sampled in space \citep[see Figure 1 and 5 in ][]{KetAl2008JGR}. The effect of this grid anisotropy can be seen in moist simulations, such as aqua-planet experiments \citep{MWO2016JAMES,MWO2016JAMES}. Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes} show a PDF of instantaneous upward vertical velocity $\omega$ for one year of an aqua-planet experiment using CAM-SE. The vertical velocity is classified by GLL weights pertaining to nodes lying on element corners ('corner nodes'), nodes along the element edges ('edge nodes') and nodes within the interior of an element ('interior nodes'). Consistently, the magnitude of $\omega$ is larger for smaller grid cell areas, due to the ability of smaller grid cells areas to support tighter horizontal gradients. [{\color{red}{The question is then how will the physics respond to this?}}]

\caption{A graphical illustration of the physics grid in one dimension. Three elements are shown and the filled red circles are the GLL quadrature points in each element. The red curve is the basis function representation of the field and the green filled circles are the quadrature point values. The physics grid divides each element into 3 equal-area control volumes. The histogram shows the average values over the physics grid control volumes resulting from integrating the basis functions over the respective control volumes.}
\label{fig:physgrid-1d}
\end{figure*}

The quadrature grid in high-order element-based Galerkin methods is defined to perform mathematical operations on the basis functions, e.g., computing gradients and integrals, rather than evaluating the state variables for physics-dynamics coupling. Within each element there is a high-order $C^{\infty}$ representation of state variables. One may argue that it would be more consistent to integrate the basis functions over quasi-equal area control volumes within each element and pass those control volume average values to physics rather than irregularly spaced quadrature point values. The relationship between the nodal values, the basis functions and the proposed control volumes is illustrated schematically in one-dimension in Figure \ref{fig:physgrid-1d}, and two dimension in Figure \ref{fig:grids}.

\begin{figure*}[t]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=38pc,angle=0]{figs/se-schematic.pdf}\\
\caption{A 1D schematic illustration on how CAM-SE advances the solution to the equations of motion in time. Consider 3 elements. The red filled circles are the GLL quadrature points in each element ($np=4$). Note that the quadrature points on the boundary are shared between elements. (a) Assume a degree 3 global Lagrange polynomial initial condition (red curve) which can be represented exactly by the degree 3 Lagrange basis in each element. (b) The solution to the equations of motion are advanced in time (one Runga-Kutta step) independently in each element leading to the quadrature values marked with filled purple circles. The Lagrange basis is shown with red curves connecting the purple circles. There are now two solutions, one from left and one from right, for the quadrature points at the element end points. In CAM-SE the values are averaged so that the solution is $C^0$. Note that the averaging changes the Lagrange polynomials throughout except at the internal quadrature points. (c) shows the solution after averaging. (d) Assume there is a grid-scale forcing that increases the quadrature value located at $x=3$. (e) The solution is now clearly $C^0$ at the element boundary at $x=3$. (f) Histogram shows the average values resulting in integrating the basis functions over the control volumes.}
\label{fig:se-schematic}
\end{figure*}

Integrating basis functions over control volumes may be beneficial in reducing the intrinsic oscillatory behavior of high-order basis functions within each element. Moreover, if there is a strong grid-scale forcing or oscillatory behavior near an element boundary, the solution will be least smooth near that element boundary. The element boundaries are least smooth since the boundary exchange of the continuous Galerkin method results in a degradation to $C^0$ along the element edges. This is illustrated in the context of CAM-SE on Figure \ref{fig:se-schematic}. In this case when integrating basis functions over control volumes a grid-cell average value is more representative of the values near the extrema at the element boundary than the quadrature point value.

%this should be included in the next paper (physres)
%When introducing a physics grid separate from the dynamics grid the question arises of what the resolution of the physics grid should be compared to the dynamics grid. For example, Figure \ref{fig:physgrid-1d} shows physics grids with the same, coarser and finer resolution than the GLL dynamics grid. From linear stability and accuracy analysis of numerical methods, it is a common result that the shortest resolvable wavelengths are not accurately represented. Similar arguments can be made from analyzing total kinetic energy spectra \citep{S2011LNCSE}. One may therefore argue that only believable scales should be passed to the physical parameterizations \citep{LH1997MWR}, i.e. a coarser resolution physics grid. This concept was investigated in a spectral transform model by \cite{W1999T}. On the other hand, computing physics tendencies on a higher-resolution grid compared to the dynamical core may provide a better sampling of the atmospheric state, somewhat similar to the super-parameterization \citep{G2001JAS,GRL:GRL14999,SA2007ASL} and sub-columns{\footnote{\citet{gmdd-8-5041-2015} in the context of CAM}} \citep{subcolumn,JGRD:JGRD10481} concepts. This approach was taken by \cite{M2009T} in the context of vertical refinement. \cite{W2014PTRSL} found improved forecast scores by increasing the grid-point space resolution compared to the resolution in wave-number space for the spectral transform model at ECMWF. 

%Alternatively, one could combine the two ideas and compute the state of the atmosphere on a coarser resolution grid and then use sub-columns or super-parameterization. One thereby passes believable scales to the sub-grid scale model and thereby assumes that a statistical sampling, in the case of sub-columns, or a simplified cloud-resolving model, in the case of super-parameterization, provides a more accurate sub-grid-scale tendency than sampling the Galerkin basis functions over the sub-grid-scale. [Discuss \cite{W2014PTRSL}: spectral truncation and physics (physical) grid (see page 10; conclusions)]




%Separating physics and dynamics grids has been investigated in the context of spectral transform models by \citet{TELA:TELA0009}, in which the separation was performed by truncation in wavenumber space. Parts of the physical parameterizations (microphysics) were separated in \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711} and vertical grid separation was investigated in \citet{TELA:TELA394}. In this study we run all of the parameterization on the physgrid.


%In the context of spectral transform model \citet{TELA:TELA0009} held the physics forcing scale fixed while refining the horizontal resolution of the dynamical core. In the context of microphysics \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711} did a scale separation and \citet{TELA:TELA394} separated the vertical grids. While \citet{LH1997MWR} and \citet{TELA:TELA0009} separated scales truncation of the the wave transform, we here separate scales through integrating basis functions over control volumes and , contrary to \citet{JGRD:JGRD50711}, all of the physical parameterization computations are performed on the physgrid. We focus on horizontal separation of scales here.

It is the purpose of this paper to document the design of CAM-SE with an approximately isotropic physics grid (CAM-SE-PG) in which we separate physics and dynamics grids as illustrated in one dimension above. The mapping procedures used in CAM-SE-PG are presented in Section 2. Idealized model configurations with and without topography are presented in Section 3, illustrating the marked reduction in grid imprinting in CAM-SE-PG compared with the default CAM-SE. Section 4 contains a discussion of results and concluding remarks.

\section{Methods}
Here we focus on CAM-SE, however, in principle the methods apply to any element-based high-order Galerkin model. The physics grid in CAM-SE is defined by sub-dividing each element using equi-angular gnomonic coordinate lines to define the sides of the physics grid control volumes. Note that the element boundaries are defined by equi-angular gnomonic grid lines.  The notation $nc=3$ refers to the configuration where the elements are divided into $nc\times nc=3\times 3$ quasi equal-area physics grid cells (see Figure \ref{fig:grids}). Defining the physics grid by sub-diving elements makes it possible to use the same infrastructure as used for the quadrature point values thereby facilitating its implementation in CAM-SE. Here we make use of the $NE30NP4$, $NE30NP4NC2$, $NE30NP4NC3$, and $NE30NP4NC4$ grids that use GLL quadrature point physics grid (physics and dynamics grid coincide), coarser ($nc=2$), same ($nc=3$) and finer ($nc=4$) resolution quasi equal-area physics grids, respectively, compared to the GLL point resolution. In all configurations we use degree 3 Lagrange basis ($np=4$) and $ne\times ne=30\times 30$ elements on each cubed-sphere panel resulting in an average GLL quadrature point spacing at the Equator of $1^\circ$. Vertical grid spacing is the standard CAM5 configuration ($nlev=30$).

\section{Results}

The CAM aqua-planet reference configuration (Neale and Hoskins 2001; Medeiros et al 2016) consists of an ocean covered planet in a perpetual equinox, with fixed, zonally symmetric SST temperatures that resemble the present day climatology. Two year long aqua-planet simulations are performed, using CAM-SE in the default configuration ('default'), and with the physics grid configuration ('physgrid'). A plot similar to Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes} is constructed for the physgrid simulation, in which a probability density distribution of upward vertical pressure velocities in the deep tropics is conditionally sampled based on location within the element. In the physgrid configuration, we define the sampling based on a grid cell ID of 1-9, corresponding to the location of the grid cell within the element (Figure \ref{fig:omg_locations}). Through the use of the physics grid, it appears that the dynamical state is independent of location within the element, a marked improvement over the default configuration (Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes}). Since the state is independent of in-element location, it follows that the physics forcing computed from the state should also be independent of in-element location. The low-level, mean and variance of the physics tendencies in the two simulations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tendency_imprint}. The mean physics tendencies contains modest grid imprinting in the default configuration, while in the variance field, grid imprinting is both ubiquitous and unmistakable (Figure \ref{fig:tendency_imprint}). Through the use of the physics grid, the grid imprinting is all but eliminated from mean and variance of the physics tendencies (Figure \ref{fig:tendency_imprint}), as expected from Figure \ref{fig:omg_locations}.
