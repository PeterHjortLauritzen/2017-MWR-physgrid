\section{Introduction}
An increasing number of numerical methods publications in the atmospheric science literature concern transport, shallow-water, and three-dimensional models employing element-based high-order Galerkin discretizations such as finite-element and discontinuous Galerkin methods \citep[for an introduction to these methods see, e.g., ][]{Durran,NLL2011LNCSE}. Some global models based on Galerkin methods have reached a level of maturity for which they are being considered for next generation climate and weather models due to their inherent conservation properties, high-order accuracy (for smooth problems), high parallel efficiency, high processor efficiency, and geometric flexibility facilitating mesh-refinement applications. NCAR's Community Atmosphere Model \citep[CAM; ][]{CAM5} offers a dynamical core based on continuous Galerkin finite elements \citep{TF2010JCP}, referred to as CAM-SE \citep[CAM Spectral Elements; ][]{DetAl2012IJHPCA,TES2008JPCS,LetAl2017MWR}. CAM-SE is, in particular, being used for high resolution climate modeling \citep[e.g., ][]{JAME:JAME20125,BetAl2013JC,RetAl2015GRL} and static mesh-refinement applications \citep[e.g., ][]{FT2004MWR,ZetAl2014JC,ZetAl2014JCb,GetAl2014GMD,RHUZ2016}. Other examples of models based on high-order Galerkin methods that are being considered for `operational' weather-climate applications are \citet{Giraldo20083849}, \citet{NCT2009CF} and \citet{BSBDK2013TCFD}.

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Example of CAM-SE GLL quadrature grids, marked with red filled circles, (a \& c) on the cubed-sphere and (b \& d) in an element.

(a) and (c) have the same average grid-spacing at the Equator (7.5$^\circ$) which is obtained by using (a) $4\times 4$ ($ne=4$) and (b) $2\times 2$ ($ne=2$) elements on each cubed-sphere face/panel, respectively. The element boundaries are marked with thick light blue lines. The grid configurations shown on (a) and (c) are referred to as $ne4np4$ and $ne2np8$, respectively.}
\label{fig:gll-grids}
\end{figure}

Traditionally the state of the atmosphere passed to the sub-grid-scale parameterizations (also referred to as {\em{physics}}) for models based on finite-volume and finite-difference methods has been the cell-averaged state in each control volume and the grid-point value, respectively. For the regular latitude-longitude, cubed-sphere and icosahedral grids the distance between the grid-points is gradually varying for finite-volume/finite-difference discretizations. If the same physics-dynamics coupling paradigm is applied to high-order element-based Galerkin methods, the state of the atmosphere passed to physics would be evaluated at the quadrature points. In the case of CAM-SE these are the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) quadrature points. Having the physics and dynamics grids coincide is obviously convenient since no interpolation is needed (which could disrupt conservation properties) and the number of degrees of freedom on both grids is exactly the same. A unique aspect of the high-order quadrature rules is that the nodes within an element are not equally spaced. For example, Figure \ref{fig:gll-grids} shows GLL points on an individual element of a cubed-sphere grid for degree 3 ($np=4$ quadrature points) and degree 7 ($np=8$ quadrature points) Lagrange polynomial basis in CAM-SE. Both grids have the same average resolution on the sphere (due to different number of elements), however, the higher the order of the quadrature rule the less equi-distant are the quadrature points. GLL quadrature points cluster near the edges and, in particular, the corners of the elements.

Figure is constructed from one year of six hourly data, +/- $10^\circ$ from the equator from the equator and at all vertical levels. Note the consistently larger magnitude $omega$ values for boundary nodes, compared to interior nodes. Grid imprinting is exacerbated since the irregular state is commuted through the physical parmaterizations.}\label{fig:omega-se-volumes}
\end{figure}

Parameterizations use the state of the atmosphere from the dynamical core as the large-scale state for computing sub-grid-scale processes. For example, the dynamical core defines the large-scale environment for closing quasi-equilibrium-type convection schemes \citep{AS1974JAS}. One may think of the dynamical core state as the average state of the atmosphere over a control volume as inherent to finite-volume methods. For finite-difference methods the point value is thought of as representative for the atmospheric state in the vicinity of the point value and one can usually associate a volume with the grid-point. Hence the physics grid (the grid on which the state of the atmosphere is evaluated and passed to physics) and the dynamics grid (the grid the dynamical core uses) coincide. If we apply this concept to GLL quadrature values then a volume associated with the quadrature point should be defined. An example of that is shown on Figure \ref{fig:cv-grids} where control volumes have been defined around the quadrature points so that the spherical area of the control volumes exactly match the Gaussian weight multiplied by the metric term (these weights are used for integrating the basis functions over the elements and can therefore, in this context, be interpreted as areas). [{\color{red}{Mark: could we be mathematically more rigorous? perhaps an appendix describing the iterative algorithm?}}] This grid is used in the NCAR CESM (Community Earth System Model) coupler for passing states between ocean, atmosphere and land components since the current remapping method is finite-volume based and therefore requires control volumes {\footnote{it is noted that methods exist that do not require control volumes for conservative interpolation \citep{UT2015MWR}}}. Hence the components `see' an irregular atmospheric grid. Similarly, the parameterizations in the atmosphere `see' a state that is anisotropically sampled in space \citep[see Figure 1 and 5 in ][]{KetAl2008JGR}. Physical inconsistencies may arise, for example, if assumptions inherent to sub-grid parameterizations break down only at the smallest control volumes of the grid. 

It would be incorrect to interpet the irregular size of control volumes in Figure~\ref{fig:cv-grids} as an equivalent spread in the scales of motion resolved by the dynamical core. The scales of motion are defined by the degree of the Lagrange basis in each element, and the nodes may be viewed as irregularly spaced samples of an underlying spectrally truncated state. From this perspective, one would expect the solution to be independent of control volume size. An aqua-planet simulation \citep{NH2000ASL,MWO2016JAMES} is carried out using CAM-SE (Figure~\ref{fig:omega-se-volumes}), and the probability density distribution of the upward vertical pressure velocity ($\omega$), conditionally sampled based on three categories - `interior nodes', with their large grid cell areas, and `edge' and `corner' nodes with their characteristically smaller grid cell areas - is shown in Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes}. Their is an apparent dependence on control volume size, with interior nodes being characteristically sluggish and intially at odds with our expectation. However, the lack of a distinction between `corner' and `edge' solutions is inconsistent with our expectation. It turns out, that `corner' and `edge' solutions are similar because they have something else in common - they both lie on an element boundary. The division of solutions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:omega-se-volumes} is actually between whether a node is, or is not situated on an element boundary, and is a nuanced signature of element-based Galerkin methods.

The quadrature grid in high-order element-based Galerkin methods is defined to perform mathematical operations on the basis functions, e.g., computing gradients and integrals, rather than evaluating the state variables for physics-dynamics coupling. While the interior quadrature nodes are high-order $C^{\infty}$, the smoothness of boundary nodes are constrained by the need to patch neighboring solutions together to form a global solution. This boundary exchange results in a $C^0$ degradation at element boundaries (Figure~\ref{fig:se-schematic}). Through evaluating the physics at the nodal points, strong grid-scale forcing or oscillatory behavior near an element boundary may exacerbate the discontinuity (Figure~\ref{fig:se-schematic}). The greater magnitude vertical motion of boundary nodes in Figure~\ref{fig:omega-se-volumes} is therefore due to the systematically tighter pressure gradients on element boundaries. One may argue that it would be more consistent to integrate the basis functions over quasi-equal area control volumes within each element and pass those control volume average values to physics rather than irregularly spaced quadrature point values. In this case when integrating basis functions over control volumes a grid-cell average value is more representative of the values near the extrema at the element boundary than the quadrature point value. The relationship between the nodal values, the basis functions and the proposed control volumes is illustrated schematically in one-dimension in Figure \ref{fig:physgrid-1d}).

It is the purpose of this paper to document the design of CAM-SE with an approximately isotropic physics grid (CAM-SE-PG) in which we separate physics and dynamics grids as illustrated in one dimension above. The mapping procedures used in CAM-SE-PG are presented in Section 2. Idealized model configurations with and without topography are presented in Section 3, illustrating the marked reduction in grid imprinting in CAM-SE-PG compared with the default CAM-SE. Section 4 contains a discussion of results and concluding remarks.

\section{Methods}
Here we focus on CAM-SE, however, in principle the methods apply to any element-based high-order Galerkin model. The physics grid in CAM-SE is defined by sub-dividing each element using equi-angular gnomonic coordinate lines to define the sides of the physics grid control volumes. Note that the element boundaries are defined by equi-angular gnomonic grid lines. The notation $pg=3$ refers to the configuration where the elements are divided into $pg\times pg=3\times 3$ quasi equal-area physics grid cells (see Figure \ref{fig:grids}). Defining the physics grid by sub-diving elements makes it possible to use the same infrastructure as used for the quadrature point values thereby facilitating its implementation in CAM-SE. Here we make use of the $ne30np4$ and $ne30pg3$ grids that use GLL quadrature point physics grid (physics and dynamics grid coincide), and the same ($pg=3$) resolution quasi equal-area physics grids, respectively. In all configurations we use degree 3 Lagrange basis ($np=4$) and $ne\times ne=30\times 30$ elements on each cubed-sphere panel resulting in an average GLL quadrature point spacing at the Equator of $1^\circ$. Vertical grid spacing is the standard CAM5 configuration ($nlev=30$).

\section{Results}

The CAM aqua-planet reference configuration \citep{NH2000ASL,MWO2016JAMES} consists of an ocean covered planet in a perpetual equinox, with fixed, zonally symmetric SST temperatures idealized after the present day climatology. Two year long aqua-planet simulations are performed, using CAM-SE in the $ne30np4$ default configuration, and with the $ne30pg3$ physics grid configuration. A plot similar to Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes} is constructed for the $ne30pg3$ simulation, in which a probability density distribution of upward $omega$ in the deep tropics is conditionally sampled based on location within the element. In the $ne30pg3$ configuration, the sampling is based on a grid cell index 1-9, corresponding to the control volume location within the element (Figure \ref{fig:omg_locations}). Through the use of the physics grid, the dynamical state appears independent of location within the element, a marked improvement over the $ne30np4$ (Figure \ref{fig:omega-se-volumes}). Since the state is independent of in-element location, it follows that the physics forcing, which is evaluted from the state, should also be independent of within-element location. The low-level, mean and variance of the physics tendencies in the two aqua-planet simulations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:tendency_imprint}. The mean physics tendencies contains modest grid imprinting in the default configuration, while in the variance field, grid imprinting is both ubiquitous and unmistakable (Figure~\ref{fig:tendency_imprint}). The variance is larger on boundary nodes (Figure~\ref{fig:tendency_imprint}), reuslting in a clear `stitching' pattern resembling the cube-sphere grid. In $ne30pg3$, the grid imprinting is all but eliminated based on the mean and variance of the physics tendencies (Figure~\ref{fig:tendency_imprint}).

Grid imprinting is observed along the element boundaries in $ne30np4$, but is absent from the $ne30pg3$ simulation.}

\end{figure}

Grid imprinting associated with the flow around obstacles is more problematic than that encountered on the aqua-planets. In order to diagnose grid imprinting associated with topographic flow, an idealized held-suarez conifugration \citep{HS1994} is outfitted with real world topography, and ran for a year using the $ne30np4$ and $ne30pg3$ configurations. Figure~\ref{fig:FHS-contours} shows the mean $omega$ at two different vertical levels in the middle troposphere. At higher latitudes (such as southern Andes), the flow is smooth, conforming reasonably to the underlying topography. At lower latitudes, over the Andes or the Himlayas, their is a clear preferance for larger magnitude vertical motion to occur at the element boundaries. The vertical structure of $omega$ in regions of strong grid-imprinting is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:FHS-transect}, which are great-circle distance-pressure transects over the Andes and Himalayas. The $omega$ field indicates large magnitude upward motion occurs as the flow approaches the foot of a topographic obstacle. Compensating downward motion tends to occur about 2 GLL nodes downwind of the strong upward motion (although sometimes they form upwind). The full troposphere upward-downwawrd couplets are an indication that grid imprinting due to topography is enhanced in regions of weak stratificaiton, such as occurs in the deep tropics, with forced upslope flow facilitating the release of gravitational instabilty. The greater magnitude vertical motion is a result of the characteristically tighter pressure gradients at element boundaries. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=19pc,angle=0]{figs/FHS_contours.pdf}\\
\caption{Mean $omega$ at two model levels in the middle troposphere, in a Held-Suarez configuration outfitted with real world topography. Three different model configurations are depicted, (Left) $ne30np4$, (Middle) $ne30pg3$ and (Right) $ne30np4$ in an AMIP configuration. The $omega$ field is computed from the final 12 months of a 13 month simulation. Black lines denote the great circle transects in \ref{fig:FHS-transect}.}
\label{fig:FHS-contours}
\end{figure}


The grid-imprinting tends to be exaggerated in the modified held-suarez configuration, compared to more realistic configurations using a complete physical parameterization package. Figure~\ref{fig:FHS-contours} depicts the $omega$ field in an AMIP simulation, which contains less grid imprinting compared to the Held-Suarez configuration through the use of the CAM6 physics pacakge \citep{}. Physics packages contain convection schemes, whose purpose is to remove gravitational instabilites through subgrid-scale vetical mixing. Since the idealized Held-Suarez physics does not contain a convection scheme, the dynamical core tends to be more active in removing gravitational instability, compared to a full physics configuration. Note that the implications of this finding are that one can accept a level of grid-impriniting in the modified Held-Suarez configuration, and trust that it will be absent in more real-world configurations.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=19pc,angle=0]{figs/FHS_transect.pdf}\\
\caption{Great circle distance-pressure transect of $omega$ in the Held-Suarez simulations with realistic topography. $omega$ field derived from the final 12 months of a 13 month simulation.}
\label{fig:FHS-transect}
\end{figure}

Through the use of the physics grid, grid imprinting due to topographic flow in reduced (Figures~\ref{fig:FHS-contours} and \ref{fig:FHS-transect}). The native topography lives on the physics grid, and the surface geopotential is mapped to the nodal points at run-time in $ne30pg3$. The mapping method does not introduce new extreme to the nodal points, and the topography tends to be smoother at the element boundaries, relative to $ne30np4$. In regions of gravitational instability, the flow is damped compared to the $ne30np4$ configuration. Gravitational instability results in large magnitude physics tendencies (predominantly grid-scale condensation), whch are damped at element boundaries through the use of the physics grid (Figure~\ref{tendency_imprint}).
